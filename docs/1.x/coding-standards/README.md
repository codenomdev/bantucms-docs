# Coding Standards
Like many large projects, Codenom Project and Bantucms Open Source have coding standards. Use the coding standards when you contribute to the codebase or create extensions.

## Contributing
The Bantucms Coding Standard is created and maintained by the Bantucms community! See the [Contribution guide](../coding-standards/contributing.html) if you'd like to participate.
