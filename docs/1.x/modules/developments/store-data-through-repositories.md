# Store Data Through Repository

## Contract
Laravel's Contracts are a set of interfaces that define the core services provided by the framework. For example, an `Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\Queue` contract defines the methods needed for queueing jobs, while the `Illuminate\Contracts\Mail\Mailer` contract defines the methods needed for sending an e-mail.

Each contract has a corresponding implementation provided by the framework. For example, Laravel provides a queue implementation with a variety of drivers, and a mailer implementation that is powered by SwiftMailer.

All of the Laravel contracts live in their own GitHub repository. This provides a quick reference point for all available contracts, as well as a single, decoupled package that may be utilized by package developers.

### Create Contract
- You have to understand the [folder structure in the module](../README.md#directory-structure)
::: tip
If you do not find the `Contracts` folder in the root of your module, you can create a `Contracts` folder first
:::
The `Contracts` folder structure in your module:
~~~directory-structure
- modules/
    - ACME/HelloWorld/
        ...
        - Contracts/
        ...
~~~
- Now, create an interface file named as `HelloWorld.php`
```php
<?php

namespace ACME\HelloWorld\Contracts;

interface HelloWorld
{
}
```
::: tip
The contract file allows you to modify file names like: `HelloWorld.php`, `HelloWorldInterface.php`, and `HelloWorldContract.php`
:::
::: warning
**DO NOT** use the file names `HelloWorldModel.php`, and `HelloWorldRepository.php`. The file name will be the same as the Model and Repository name. See the topic [Naming Conventions for details](../../coding-standards/php.md).
:::

## Repositories
Generally, we wrote all of our application logic in the controller. Thereâ€™s an alternative approach of development that abstracts some calls into PHP classes called Repositories. The idea is that we can decouple models from controllers and assign a readable name's to complicated queries.

This file defines our Repository class. Instances of this class have a model property that we tie to an Eloquent model. Once this is bound in the constructor we can call Eloquent methods like findOrFail, update or all from the class methods.

### Create Repositories
- You have to understand the [folder structure in the module](../README.md#directory-structure)
::: tip
If you do not find the `Repository` folder in the root of your module, you can create a `Repository` folder first
:::
The `Repository` folder structure in your module:
~~~directory-structure
- modules/
    - ACME/HelloWorld/
        ...
        - Repository/
        ...
~~~
- Now, create a file `HelloWorldRepository.php` and create the `model()` method in repository class which returns the path of your contract class:
```php
<?php

namespace ACME\HelloWorld\Repositories;

use Bantucms\Framework\App\Eloquent\AbstractRepository;

class HelloWorldRepository extends AbstractRepository
{
    /**
    * Specify Model class name
    *
    * @return mixed
    */
    function model()
    {
        return 'ACME/HelloWorld/Contracts/HelloWorld';
    }
}
```
::: warning
**DO NOT** use the file names `HelloWorldModel.php`, and `HelloWorldContract.php`. The file name will be the same as the Model and Contract name. See the topic [Naming Conventions for details](../../coding-standards/php.md).

## Binding Interfaces To Implementations
A very powerful feature of the service container is its ability to bind an interface to a given implementation. [More information about bindings, see the official information](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/container#binding-interfaces-to-implementations).

### Register Binding
After creating all the files stated above, we have to modified a provider as `HelloWorldServiceProvider.php`. In this file, models which are used in this package are registered. You may check below code:

```php
<?php

namespace ACME\HelloWorld\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use ACME\HelloWorld\Contracts\HelloWorld as HelloWorldContract;
use ACME\HelloWorld\Models\HelloWorldModel;

/**
* HelloWorldServiceProvider
*
* @copyright 2020 Codenom Dev. (http://www.codenom.com)
*/
class HelloWorldServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * @var string $moduleName
     */
    protected $moduleName = 'ACME_HelloWorld';

    /**
     * @var string $moduleNameLower
     */
    protected $moduleNameLower = 'acme_helloworld';

    ...

    /**
    * Register services.
    *
    * @return void
    */
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(
            HelloWorldContract::clas,
            HelloWorldModel::class
        );
    }
}
```
